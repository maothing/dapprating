# dapprating
This is a platform that collects and organizes DAPPs available on the EOS mainnet, introduces DAPPs in detail, and objectively evaluates and analyzes DAPPs.

The introduction of DAPP will be displayed in different categories, including the type of DAPP, the genesis team, the DAPP website, etc.

DAPP evaluation includes objective evaluation of interface aesthetics and ease of use, user ease of use, and whether smart contracts are at risk.

DAPP rating includes platform rating and user rating

The platform will rate the EOS DAPP according to its own analysis. The platform will make every effort to evaluate and score objectively.

Users can also log in to the platform and rate their favorite DAPPs.

Each user can use the EOS account to bind the platform account to rate and evaluate the EOS DAPP. The platform will automatically analyze the main network data through the program, manually analyze the main network data, and analyze whether the bound account uses the evaluated DAPP and other methods to ensure the fairness of the evaluation.

The analysis tool will be open sourced on github for free trials by developers with the same needs.
